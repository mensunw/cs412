    <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
    <p>
      Since discovering <span class="highlight">League of Legends</span> in 2021 and diving into the fascinating world
      of
      <span class="highlight">machine learning</span> in 2023, Iâ€™ve always envisioned merging these two passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      After learning how to develop a full-stack application, I decided to bring this idea to life by creating an
      interface that combines competitive gaming and artificial intelligence, allowing others to experience predictive
      modeling firsthand.
